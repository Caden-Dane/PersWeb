This project is a basic Static Website created with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrapt v5.1.3.

Its part of a personal project to help friends (for free) who are starting/have businesses and need an online presence. 

The sites are far from being "out of this world" or fantastic, but they are created with purpose and the idea/desire 
to create miningful tools for real world problem; in this case, an online presence. 

The designs are influenced by the brand book of the businesses and feedback of the owners. 

If you're interested in a similar static website for your company/project or to help a friend, feel free to fork this repo. Or contact me. 
Most of the segments are well commented for you to replace the information, and if your understand HTML and CSS you'll have it very easy going. 

If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up via LinkedIn (link in my profile). I'd be happy to help. 


##### OBS: It's not finished! I published it on GH for live feedback.
